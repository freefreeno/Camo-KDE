 Camo-theme-for-KDE-Plasma
 
This is a well tested and robust set of color schemes,Plasma themes and GTK themes. Icons in the screenshots are as usual the Newaita icons. I havent found any icons that can come close to matching the look of these icons. The Newaita icons are found here: https://github.com/cbrnix/Newaita
